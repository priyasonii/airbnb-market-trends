Explore the Airbnb Market Trends for New York City! :hotel: :houses:
</b></p>

<p align="center">
One of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, I took a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.

I recently completed this exciting data analysis project where I explored Airbnb listing data to provide valuable insights into the short-term rental market in New York City (a city that I personally love).
This project was a great opportunity for me to enhance my data analysis skills to real-world datasets and derive meaningful insights.
